### Idea

I had this idea in my head to for a portfolio app where you would command a rocket. After launch, you'll venture into space and come across planets and stuff. A nice popup modal will give little bits of info about me. You will collect the gathered data in a journal and at the end, all data will show on the screen. Something like a search and rescue story would be cute I reckon.

This will also be a nice way to learn the technologies, I'll likely use tech in a very unnessecary way just to learn stuf. For example, thinking of using a backend for the information that will be shown.
